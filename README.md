# WeatherGuy

A JavaScript weather app using the weatherapi.com API.

> A single page website using JavaScript was built using WebPacker.
> Webpacker was used to bundle the stylesheets and various JS files.
> Clicking a navbar tab wipes out the current contents of the page and then renders the new contents from a different JS file.
> Refactoring was done to keep the code DRY.
